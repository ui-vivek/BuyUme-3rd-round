Sir/Mam,

Before checking my code, I humble request you to please read this.
The question you have given to me is 

print the longest similar characters sequentially in both the strings.
Let str1 = "ALHIOPK" Let str2 = "KHXOLPMK
Output: "KHOPK"
the expected output is incorrect because it is clearly noticeable that "L" is missing from the output.  "L" is in the string 1 and string 2 also, so the expected output would be "KHOLPK".

I have made the code for the correct output, so look at the problem please.

I hope my you are impressed with my solutions with different types of approaches.
